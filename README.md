# Constructors

Default constructor. Compliler generates only when no other constrcutor is defined. Access modifier for default constructor is same as that of the class it is contained inside. It contains call to super constructor.
A constructor will not have any return type, exception throws.
A constrcutor allows only access modifiers - public, protected, default, private. Synchronized is not allowed. 
A method can share the same name as a constructor. However, not recommended.
